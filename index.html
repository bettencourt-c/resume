		<h1>Clinical Professional Experience</h1>
		    <h2><b>Mount Auburn Rheumatology:</b> Medical Assistant and Medical Secretary</h2>
		    	<p>May 2025 - Present<br>
			<br>
			Full time clinical work in an ambulatory setting. Due to the nature of my role, I experience a wide range of clincical scenarios. Including but not limited to; rooming patients, taking vitals, documenting medical history using EPIC, requesting prior authorizations and appealing associated denials, as well as pending lab orders and prescriptions for the physician to sign.
			</p>
		    <h2><b>Quest Diagnostics:</b> Health Screener</h2>
		    	<p>July 2024 - Present<br>
			<br>
			Per diem clinical work, specializing in point of care biometric screening for patients of diverse backgrounds, ranging from manufacturing sites to executive suites. The focus of this testing is to screen participants for high risk conditions, specifically high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. Additionally I train new hires onsite to ensure that they understand Quest’s protocols and operating procedures.

			</p>
		    <h2><b>Center for Cognitive and Brain Health:</b> Undergraduate Researcher</h2>
		    	<p>July 2024 - Present<br>
			<br>
			At the Laboratory for the Scientific Study of Dance, I have contributed to creating a composite measure of health based on biological factors such as telomere length and body composition. Our team has also quantified the impact of dance on muscle function in healthy individuals, as well as the impact of dance on Parkinson’s Disease and healthy aging. As part of these projects, I analyzed survey and biometric data, participated in manuscript writing, and interviewed patients. Currently, I am writing and submitting a grant to the NIH.

		<h1>Laboratory Professional Experience</h1>
		    <h2><b>Takeda Pharmaceuticals:</b> Research Associate, Protein Biophysical Analytics Co-op</h2>
		    	<p>January 2024 - June 2024<br>
			<br>
			The core focus of my role within the Global Biologics team was in vitro high-throughput plate-based flow cytometry assay screens for the selection and optimization of drug candidates. I also developed an immunogenicity risk assessment assay as well as an FcRn binding assay. I eventually combined separate assay tools to create a single, more robust assay and consequently used my data to build a use-case for proceeding forward with commercial assay development.
			</p>
		    <h2><b</b>CAMP4 Therapeutics:</b> Research Associate, Discovery II Co-op, Preclinical</h2>
		    	<p>January 2023 - August 2023<br>
			<br>
			I aided in assay development for the quantification of antisense oligonucleotides in various biological matrices. Eventually, I transitioned to high throughput screening to develop pharmacokinetic profiles that were used for Investigational New Drug applications. As the company prepared for their first regulatory filing, I began doing quality control for regulatory documents due to my attention to detail and ability to work under tight deadlines. I concluded my co-op by presenting the newly validated methods and resulting pharmacokinetic profiles completed by our group to the R&D team. 
			</p>
		    <h2><b>American College of Thessaloniki:</b> Undergraduate Research Assistant</h2>
		    	<p>March 2022 - May 2022<br>
			<br>
			My group analyzed the antibacterial activity of a propolis extract, a compound commonly used in the local region as an antibacterial astringent, against bacteria commonly found on human skin. We worked collaboratively through key aspects of microbiology and aseptic techniques, such as Kirby-Bauer assays. Our research found preliminary evidence that propolis inhibited bacterial growth, and may work synergistically with antibiotics.
